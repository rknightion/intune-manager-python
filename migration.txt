## 🤖 LLM Agent Instructions for Working with This Document

### On Session Start
1. **Always read this file first** to understand current project state
2. **Check "Current Migration Tasks"** section to identify active work
3. **Review most recent `[>] IN PROGRESS` items** to understand what was being worked on
4. **Read blockers marked `[!]`** to avoid redundant attempts at blocked tasks

### During Active Work
1. **Mark tasks `[>]` when starting work** — update status immediately when beginning a task
2. **Keep exactly ONE task `[>]` at a time** (unless parallelizable work)
3. **Update task status in real-time** — don't batch status updates
4. **Add inline notes** after task descriptions when encountering:
   - Implementation decisions made
   - Blockers or issues discovered
   - File paths or modules created/modified
   - API changes or breaking changes
   Example: `- [x] P6.5.2: Build device table — NOTE: Used QTableView with proxy model for filtering; main widget in ui/devices/widgets.py:DeviceTableWidget`
5. **Complete as many sub/child tasks along with the parent at the same time as reasonable especially if they are related
6. **Use the contxct of every outstanding task you know about to inform how to implement functionality in the current task (to avoid having to duplicate effort later on)
7. **All tasks in this work relate to migrating a Swift macos app to a python cross platform app. You can access the original swift app at /Users/rob/repos/IntuneManager if you need it for context

### Task Completion
1. **Mark `[x]` ONLY when fully complete** — if partial, leave as `[>]` with status note
2. **Do NOT mark complete if**:
   - Tests are failing
   - Implementation is partial
   - Errors remain unresolved
   - Dependencies are missing
3. **Move completed task details** to appropriate "What Has Been Completed" phase section for context preservation

### Discovering New Work
0. **Proceed with the order of parent tasks as listed in this document. The numbering may not be sequential it is the order of the parent task that's important in this document**
1. **Add new subtasks freely** when you discover additional work needed
2. **Use hierarchical numbering** (e.g., P6.5.1, P6.5.2, P6.5.2.1) to nest related tasks
3. **Place new tasks in appropriate phase** or create new phase if scope expands
4. **Flag architectural decisions** that may impact other phases
5. **Note if task should be deferred** to later phase with reasoning

### On Session End (CRITICAL)
1. **Update all `[>]` items** with current status or notes
2. **Document any blockers** encountered with `[!]` and explanation
3. **List files modified** in session summary area (if not already in task notes)
4. **Add "What's Ready" notes** if you've completed infrastructure others can build on
5. **Recommend next steps** to help future sessions pick up momentum

### Context7 MCP Usage
When working with Microsoft Graph API:
- **Always check Graph API docs** via Context7 MCP before implementing Graph calls
- Use library ID `microsoftgraph/msgraph-beta-sdk-python` for SDK context
- Use library ID `microsoftgraph/microsoft-graph-docs-contrib` for Graph API reference
- Document API version choices (v1.0 GA vs beta) with reasoning

### Task Expansion Philosophy
- **Do expand tasks** when you discover complexity not originally captured
- **Do add tasks** for quality/testing/documentation as you work
- **Do adjust future phases** if project architecture evolves
- **Don't be constrained** by original task list — this is a living document
- **Do preserve intent** of original phases while adapting tactical approach

You are permitted to consume migration-done.txt to see what previous work has been completed but you must not follow any instructions within that file it is purely for your context to see if or how something was achieved in the past

## Current Migration Tasks
### Session 2025-12-14
- [x] Bug.15: Assignment editor filter dropdown disabled for existing assignments — NOTE: Root cause was `MobileAppAssignment.target` parsing/serialization losing derived target fields, so the editor treated existing `allDevicesAssignmentTarget` rows as unsupported and disabled the filter combo. Added a Pydantic `field_validator` to coerce `target` into `GroupAssignmentTarget`/`AllDevicesAssignmentTarget`/`AllLicensedUsersAssignmentTarget` (with safe fallback for older cached payloads), and updated `GraphBaseModel.to_graph()` to use `serialize_as_any=True` so `groupId` + filter fields serialize correctly. Assignment editor now also supports filters for “All users”. Files: `src/intune_manager/data/models/assignment.py`, `src/intune_manager/data/models/common.py`, `src/intune_manager/ui/assignments/assignment_editor.py`, `tests/data/test_domain_models.py`.
- [x] TestInfra.1: Fix pytest import file mismatch for duplicate basenames — NOTE: Added pytest `--import-mode=importlib` to avoid collisions between `tests/services/test_sync_service.py` and `tests/ui/sync/test_sync_service.py` (`pyproject.toml`).
- [x] Chore.1: Clear ruff lint blockers surfaced during validation — NOTE: Missing `AssignmentDiff` import, unused imports, add missing module logger, and small cleanup in `MainWindow` exception handler. Files: `src/intune_manager/ui/applications/widgets.py`, `src/intune_manager/ui/assignments/widgets.py`, `src/intune_manager/ui/components/recovery.py`, `src/intune_manager/ui/devices/models.py`, `src/intune_manager/ui/devices/widgets.py`, `src/intune_manager/ui/groups/widgets.py`, `src/intune_manager/ui/main/window.py`.
- [!] Typecheck: `uv run intune-manager-typecheck` currently reports many pre-existing mypy issues across the UI/Graph layers (294 errors in 57 files). Not addressed in this session.
- [!] Tests: `uv run intune-manager-tests` now collects successfully, but has multiple pre-existing failures/errors (auth/device/sync/UI). Not addressed in this session.

### Session 2025-10-26
- [x] UX.1: Remove legacy alert banner + blocking progress dialog — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/ui/components/alerts.py` deleted, `src/intune_manager/ui/main/window.py` now routes banner calls to sticky toasts and dashboard refresh uses inline status instead of `ProgressDialog`.
- [x] Data.1: Keep cache + status metrics scoped to the active tenant — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/ui/main/window.py` now passes `tenant_id` into `SyncService.refresh_all`, dashboard controller normalises string enum values, and compliance/assignment metrics no longer misreport stale caches.
- [x] Graph.1: Fixed Microsoft Graph `memberOf` 400 errors — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/services/groups.py:239-292` removed unsupported `$filter=isof('microsoft.graph.group')` parameter and `ConsistencyLevel: eventual` header; now filters client-side by checking `@odata.type == "#microsoft.graph.group"` in response.
- [x] UI.1: Fixed PySide6 `StateFlag` AttributeError in device delegates — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/ui/devices/delegates.py` updated to import `QStyle` and use `QStyle.StateFlag.State_Selected` instead of deprecated `QStyleOptionViewItem.StateFlag.State_Selected` (lines 79, 157).

### Session 2025-10-27
- [x] UX.2: Remove blocking ProgressDialog from device refresh (read operation) — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/ui/devices/widgets.py` removed modal `ProgressDialog` from device list refresh (lines 970-978), changed `set_busy()` to `blocking=False`, simplified `_finish_refresh()` and `_handle_refresh_progress()` methods; device refresh now non-blocking like dashboard.
- [x] UX.3: Remove blocking ProgressDialog from group refresh (read operation) — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/ui/groups/widgets.py` removed modal `ProgressDialog` from group list refresh (lines 946-954), changed `set_busy()` to `blocking=False`, simplified `_finish_refresh()` method; group refresh now non-blocking like dashboard.
- [x] UX.4: Fix empty toast notifications on startup — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/ui/components/notifications.py:125,256-259` added `setMaximumWidth(400)` directly to QLabel (line 125) to constrain wrapped text width, added `container_layout.activate()` (line 256) and `updateGeometry()` calls before `adjustSize()` to force proper height calculation for multi-line text; also added `setMaximumWidth(450)` to frame (line 82); resolves "empty colored bars" and insufficient toast height issues during initial sync.
- [x] Graph.2: Handle HTTP 400 errors gracefully for app icon fetches — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/services/applications.py:249` expanded error handling to treat both 404 and 400 status codes as "icon not available" instead of critical errors; prevents error toasts when largeIcon/$value endpoint is unsupported for certain app types.
- [x] Graph.3: Increase httpx timeout for complex Graph API queries — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/graph/client.py:762-767` added explicit `httpx.Timeout` configuration (connect=10s, read=60s, write=30s, pool=5s) to `RateLimitedAsyncClient` initialization; resolves timeout errors when fetching audit events with filters and other complex Graph API queries that exceed default 5-second timeout.
- [x] UX.5: Fix toast notification text cropping — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/ui/components/notifications.py:125` reduced label `setMaximumWidth` from 400px to 380px to account for frame padding (24px) and close button (36px), ensuring text doesn't get cropped in multi-line notifications.
- [x] Service.1: Initialize missing AssignmentService in bootstrap — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/bootstrap.py:24,113,136,128` added `AssignmentService` import, created instance with `client_factory` parameter, added to `ServiceRegistry` return, and updated service_count to 7; resolves "Assignment service not configured" warnings throughout application and enables assignment workflows in Applications and Assignments modules.

### Session 2025-10-28
- [x] UI.2: Fix QListWidgetItem parent keyword argument crash — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/ui/applications/bulk_assignment.py:206,225` changed `QListWidgetItem(label, parent=self._app_list)` to `QListWidgetItem(label, self._app_list)` (parent must be positional argument in PySide6); resolves AttributeError crash when opening Bulk Assignment dialog.
- [x] UI.3: Add exception handling to Edit Assignments dialog — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/ui/applications/widgets.py:831-848` wrapped `AssignmentEditorDialog` creation in try/except block with error notification; prevents silent failures and provides user feedback if dialog creation fails.
- [x] Data.2: Extract platform from @odata.type for MobileApp — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/data/models/application.py:70-113` added `@model_validator` to extract platform from `@odata.type` field (e.g., `#microsoft.graph.iosStoreApp` → `ios`) when `platformType` is missing from Graph API response; resolves empty platform dropdown and "unknown" platform display in Applications overview tab.
- [x] Graph.4: Add debug logging for platform data investigation — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/services/applications.py:122-131` added debug logging to log first 3 app payloads during refresh, showing `@odata.type`, `platformType` presence/value; aids in troubleshooting Graph API response structure.
- [x] UX.6: Remove App Assignments page from navigation — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/ui/main/window.py:55,87,347-356` removed `AssignmentsWidget` import, removed "App Assignments" NavigationItem, and removed assignments widget factory case; Bulk Assignment functionality remains accessible via Applications page multi-select + "Bulk assign" button.
- [x] UX.7: Increase toast notification sizing for better text display — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/ui/components/notifications.py:82,125` increased toast max width from 450px to 650px and label max width from 380px to 600px; allows longer messages to display on 2-3 lines without text cutoff; toasts automatically adjust height to content with existing `adjustSize()` logic.
- [x] Service.2: Add diagnostic logging for startup sync investigation — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/services/applications.py:88-93,98-102,119-123,162-167` added INFO-level logging at key points in refresh flow (start, cache return, Graph fetch start, completion); `src/intune_manager/services/sync.py:68-73,81-85` added phase start/completion logging; helps diagnose why applications/groups cache may appear stale despite being included in startup sync.

### Session 2025-10-29
- [x] Data.3: Auto-load group members/owners during sync — NOTE: Implemented automatic loading of group members and owners during startup/background sync instead of requiring manual "Load Members/Owners" buttons:
  - `src/intune_manager/data/sql/models.py:147-161` added `GroupMemberRecord` table with composite key (group_id, member_id) and is_owner flag; includes display_name, user_principal_name, mail, odata_type fields; TTL: 30 minutes (matching group metadata).
  - `src/intune_manager/data/sql/engine.py:18` bumped SCHEMA_VERSION from 1 to 2 for new table.
  - `src/intune_manager/data/sql/__init__.py:10,24` exported `GroupMemberRecord`.
  - `src/intune_manager/data/sql/mapper.py:11,23,204-233,243-244` added `group_members_to_records()` and `record_to_group_member()` mapper functions.
  - `src/intune_manager/data/repositories/groups.py` added member/owner caching methods: `cache_members()`, `cache_owners()`, `get_cached_members()`, `get_cached_owners()`, `is_members_stale()`, `is_owners_stale()`.
  - `src/intune_manager/services/groups.py:480-522` added `refresh_members()`, `refresh_owners()`, `get_members()`, `get_owners()` to fetch from API and cache, or retrieve from cache.
  - `src/intune_manager/services/sync.py:117-120,136-182` integrated member/owner sync into `refresh_all()`; after group metadata sync, iterates all groups and refreshes members/owners with progress logging and error handling (continues on individual group failures).
  - `src/intune_manager/ui/groups/controller.py:77-99,186-219` added `load_members_from_cache()`, `load_owners_from_cache()`, `refresh_members()`, `refresh_owners()` to bridge UI and service cache.
  - `src/intune_manager/ui/groups/widgets.py:586-591,616-617,650-651` removed "Load Members/Owners" buttons and their click handlers.
  - `src/intune_manager/ui/groups/widgets.py:1563-1580` auto-load members/owners from cache on group selection.
  - `src/intune_manager/ui/groups/widgets.py:940-965` existing refresh button now also refreshes members/owners for selected group.
  - `src/intune_manager/ui/groups/widgets.py:760-765,974-1024` added refresh handlers for detail pane member/owner refresh requests with user feedback.
  - Members and owners are now automatically synced during startup and available immediately on group selection without manual button clicks; refresh button updates both group metadata and membership data.

### Session 2025-11-02
- [x] Bug.1: Fix GroupService AttributeError in sync.py — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/services/sync.py:144` changed `group_service.list_groups(tenant_id=tenant_id)` to `group_service.list_cached(tenant_id=tenant_id)`; the correct method name is `list_cached()`, not `list_groups()`; this error was introduced in Session 2025-10-29 Data.3 when implementing automatic group member/owner loading.
- [x] UX.8: Fix toast notification sizing race condition — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/ui/components/notifications.py:257-265` deferred sizing operations (`activate()`, `updateGeometry()`, `adjustSize()`, `_relocate()`) to next event loop iteration using `QTimer.singleShot(0, _finalize_sizing)` instead of executing immediately after `show()`; this allows Qt's text layout engine to finish calculating multi-line wrapped text dimensions before the toast adjusts its size, resolving issues with toasts showing empty/incorrectly sized until text appears.
- [x] UX.9: Add toast notification logging to console — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/ui/components/notifications.py:267-273` added console logging for all toasts in `ToastManager.show_toast()`; toast level maps to log level (ToastLevel.ERROR → logger.error(), ToastLevel.WARNING → logger.warning(), ToastLevel.INFO/SUCCESS → logger.info()); enables debugging of warning/error toasts that were previously only visible in UI.
- [x] Bug.2: Fix bulk assignment tenant_id consistency — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/ui/applications/widgets.py:899-902,911` added `SettingsManager` import and logic to load active `tenant_id` in `_handle_bulk_assign_clicked()`; now passes `tenant_id` to `group_service.list_cached(tenant_id=tenant_id)` ensuring cache query uses same tenant_id as sync (resolves cache miss when groups synced with tenant_id but queried with None).
- [x] UX.10: Auto-refresh groups when bulk assignment finds no cached groups — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/ui/applications/widgets.py:912-982` implemented automatic group refresh when bulk assignment finds no cached groups; added `_refresh_groups_and_open_bulk_assign_async()` method to fetch groups from Graph API and auto-open dialog on success; refactored dialog opening into `_open_bulk_assign_dialog()` helper; eliminates manual "refresh groups first" workflow and provides seamless UX with progress feedback.
- [x] Data.4: Add app_type field for application type filtering — NOTE: Added comprehensive app type filtering capability:
  - `src/intune_manager/utils/app_types.py` (new file): Created utility functions for mapping Microsoft Graph @odata.type values to user-friendly type names (Store, LOB, VPP, WinGet, etc.); includes platform-type compatibility checking via `is_compatible()` function and `get_display_name()` for creating "Platform - Type" display strings.
  - `src/intune_manager/data/models/application.py:58,75-123`: Added `app_type` field to `MobileApp` model; updated `@model_validator` to extract both platform and app type from @odata.type (e.g., "#microsoft.graph.iosVppApp" → platform="ios", app_type="VPP").
  - `src/intune_manager/data/sql/models.py:62`: Added indexed `app_type` column to `MobileAppRecord` for fast type-based filtering.
  - `src/intune_manager/data/sql/engine.py:18`: Bumped SCHEMA_VERSION from 2 to 3 (triggers cache invalidation and fresh fetch on next startup).
  - `src/intune_manager/data/sql/mapper.py:67`: Updated `mobile_app_to_record()` mapper to include `app_type` field.
- [x] UI.4: Add type filter dropdown to Applications page — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/ui/applications/widgets.py`:
  - Lines 40,56: Added imports for `MobileAppPlatform` enum and app_types utilities (`get_display_name`, `is_compatible`).
  - Lines 483-485: Added `self._type_combo` QComboBox between platform and intent filters in `_build_filters()`.
  - Lines 1135-1139: Added `_handle_type_changed()` handler to update proxy filter and check compatibility.
  - Lines 1140-1196: Added `_check_filter_compatibility()` method to show inline warning when platform+type combination is invalid (e.g., "iOS VPP + Windows") or when no results match filters.
  - Lines 1198-1237: Updated `_apply_filter_options()` to populate all known platforms (not just those with data) and create "Platform - Type" combinations for type dropdown; added `_populate_combo_with_disabled()` to gray out platforms without cached apps.
  - Lines 433-440,508: Added `self._filter_message` QLabel styled as warning banner to display incompatibility messages inline below filter bar.
- [x] UI.5: Fix platform filter to show all platforms — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/ui/applications/widgets.py:1140-1159` changed platform dropdown from dynamically populated (only showing platforms with data) to showing all platforms from `MobileAppPlatform` enum (Windows, macOS, iOS, Android); platforms without cached apps are disabled/grayed out but remain visible, resolving issue where Windows and Android were missing from dropdown.
- [x] UI.6: Add type filtering to ApplicationFilterProxyModel — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/ui/applications/models.py`:
  - Line 210: Added `_type_filter` instance variable.
  - Lines 231-236: Added `set_type_filter()` method to update type filter and invalidate proxy.
  - Lines 294-297: Added type filtering check in `filterAcceptsRow()` to filter apps by `app.app_type` field.
- [x] Bug.3: Fix AttributeError in assignment editor dialog — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/ui/assignments/assignment_editor.py:42,448,479` added `enum_text` utility import and replaced `assignment.intent.value` with `enum_text(assignment.intent)` to safely handle both enum objects and string values from cache; resolves AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'value' when clicking "Edit assignments" button.
- [x] Data.5: Add assignment filter mode (include/exclude) support — NOTE: Implemented complete support for Intune assignment filter types:
  - `src/intune_manager/data/models/assignment.py:20-29`: Added `AssignmentFilterType` StrEnum with values NONE, INCLUDE, EXCLUDE.
  - `src/intune_manager/data/models/assignment.py:49-56`: Updated `GroupAssignmentTarget` to include `assignment_filter_id` and `assignment_filter_type` fields mapped to Graph API aliases `deviceAndAppManagementAssignmentFilterId` and `deviceAndAppManagementAssignmentFilterType`.
  - `src/intune_manager/data/models/__init__.py:6,49`: Added `AssignmentFilterType` to imports and exports.
  - `src/intune_manager/data/__init__.py:14,72`: Exported `AssignmentFilterType` from data module.
  - `src/intune_manager/data/sql/models.py:100`: Added indexed `filter_type` column to `MobileAppAssignmentRecord` for caching filter mode (include/exclude/none).
  - `src/intune_manager/data/sql/engine.py:18`: Bumped SCHEMA_VERSION from 3 to 4 for new filter_type column.
  - `src/intune_manager/data/sql/mapper.py:182-193`: Updated `assignments_to_records()` to extract and store `assignment_filter_type` from assignment targets.
- [x] UI.7: Add filter mode dropdown to assignment editor — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/ui/assignments/assignment_editor.py`:
  - Lines 31,109-114: Added `AssignmentFilterType` import and filter mode combo with three options (No filter, Include, Exclude).
  - Lines 218-220,528-542: Expanded assignment table to 6 columns, added `_filter_mode_label()` method to display filter mode as "Include"/"Exclude"/"—".
  - Lines 145-165: Updated `_handle_accept()` to create `GroupAssignmentTarget` with both `assignment_filter_id` and `assignment_filter_type` fields from UI selections.
- [x] UI.8: Add filter mode dropdown to bulk assignment wizard — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/ui/applications/bulk_assignment.py`:
  - Lines 25-29,41: Added `AssignmentFilterType` import, updated `BulkAssignmentPlan` dataclass to include `filter_mode: AssignmentFilterType` field.
  - Lines 187-195: Added filter mode combo after filter selection in configuration section.
  - Lines 340-345,365: Updated `_handle_accept()` to extract filter mode from combo and pass to `BulkAssignmentPlan`.
- [x] UI.9: Update assignment display to show filter modes — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/ui/applications/widgets.py:267-287` updated application detail pane assignment list to display filter mode alongside filter ID; format changed from "(filter: {filter_id})" to "(filter: {filter_id} - Include/Exclude)" based on `assignment_filter_type` field extracted from assignment target.
- [x] Bug.4: Fix AsyncIO RuntimeError when opening assignment editor — NOTE: Refactored assignment editor opening to use two-phase approach (async data fetch + sync dialog display):
  - `src/intune_manager/ui/applications/widgets.py:9,825-906`: Added QTimer import; split `_open_assignment_editor_async()` into `_fetch_assignment_data_async()` (async data fetching) and `_open_assignment_editor_dialog()` (synchronous dialog display); used `QTimer.singleShot(0, ...)` to break out of async context before calling `dialog.exec()`.
  - This eliminates nested `run_async()` calls that caused "RuntimeError: Cannot enter into task while another task is being executed" when user clicked Save.
- [x] UX.11: Simplify assignment configuration (remove scheduling & JSON settings) — NOTE: Removed complex configuration options from both assignment editor and bulk assignment wizard:
  - **Assignment Editor** (`src/intune_manager/ui/assignments/assignment_editor.py`):
    - Removed scheduling UI (lines 238-253): deleted QGroupBox with QDateTimeEdit widgets for start/deadline.
    - Removed JSON settings editor (lines 255-265): deleted QPlainTextEdit for advanced settings payload.
    - Removed "Apply settings" button and `_apply_settings_clicked()` handler method.
    - Removed schedule-related methods: `_schedule_label()`, `_set_schedule_controls()`, `_sync_schedule_inputs()`, `_load_settings_for_row()`.
    - Updated table from 6 to 5 columns (removed "Schedule" column); headers now: Target, Intent, Filter, Filter Mode, Type.
    - Updated header text from "tweak advanced settings" to "configure filters".
    - Removed unused imports: json, QCheckBox, QPlainTextEdit, QDateTimeEdit, QDateTime, ValidationError, AssignmentSettings, datetime helpers.
  - **Bulk Assignment Wizard** (`src/intune_manager/ui/applications/bulk_assignment.py`):
    - Removed JSON settings editor (lines 197-210): deleted QPlainTextEdit and hint label.
    - Updated `BulkAssignmentPlan` dataclass: removed `settings: AssignmentSettings | None` field.
    - Simplified `_handle_accept()`: removed JSON parsing and validation logic (lines 331-343).
    - Removed unused imports: json, QPlainTextEdit, ValidationError, AssignmentSettings.
  - Configuration now limited to: intent, target/groups, filter, filter mode only.
- [x] UX.12: Add filter/filter mode UI coupling and validation — NOTE: Improved filter mode UX to prevent invalid states:
  - **Assignment Editor** (`src/intune_manager/ui/assignments/assignment_editor.py`):
    - Added `_sync_filter_mode()` method (lines 129-138): disables filter mode dropdown when no filter selected; enables when filter selected.
    - Connected filter combo signal (line 114): `self._filter_combo.currentIndexChanged.connect(self._sync_filter_mode)`.
    - Added validation in `_handle_accept()` (lines 153-160): shows warning dialog if filter selected but mode is NONE; prevents invalid submission.
  - **Bulk Assignment Wizard** (`src/intune_manager/ui/applications/bulk_assignment.py`):
    - Added `_sync_filter_mode()` method (lines 296-305): same disable/enable logic as assignment editor.
    - Connected filter combo signal (line 90): `self._filter_combo.currentIndexChanged.connect(self._sync_filter_mode)`.
    - Added validation in `_handle_accept()` (lines 340-347): same warning dialog as assignment editor.
  - Filter mode dropdown is now grayed out when "No assignment filter" is selected; validation prevents saving filter without mode selection.

### Session 2025-11-02
- [x] UX.13: Enable text selection in application detail view — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/ui/applications/widgets.py:118-120,125-127,155-157,176-178` added `setTextInteractionFlags(Qt.TextInteractionFlag.TextSelectableByMouse)` to title label, subtitle label, description label, and all metadata field value labels in ApplicationDetailPane; users can now select and copy app names, IDs, publishers, owners, dates, and other metadata using standard OS copy/paste.

- [x] UX.14: Show filter and group display names in Assignments tab — NOTE: Enhanced Assignments tab to show human-readable names instead of GUIDs:
  - **ApplicationDetailPane** (`src/intune_manager/ui/applications/widgets.py`):
    - Lines 227-234: Updated `display_app()` signature to accept optional `groups` and `filters` parameters.
    - Lines 279-336: Refactored assignment display logic to build lookup dictionaries for groups and filters; now displays group display_name/mail instead of group_id, and filter display_name instead of filter_id.
    - Format changed from "Required → {group_id} (filter: {filter_id} - Include)" to "Required → {group_name} (Include: {filter_name})".
  - **ApplicationsWidget** (`src/intune_manager/ui/applications/widgets.py`):
    - Lines 492-493: Added `_cached_groups` and `_cached_filters` instance variables.
    - Lines 640-645: Added `_load_groups_and_filters()` method to fetch and cache groups/filters from services.
    - Lines 638,657,747-752,865-870,1422-1424: Updated all `display_app()` calls to pass cached groups and filters.
    - Calls `_load_groups_and_filters()` on app list load and refresh to keep lookup data current.

- [x] UX.15: Remove manual "Fetch icon" button from toolbar — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/ui/applications/widgets.py` removed manual icon fetch button since icons now auto-fetch:
  - Lines 443-445: Removed `_cache_icon_button` creation.
  - Line 464: Removed button from actions toolbar list.
  - Line 514: Removed click signal connection.
  - Lines 840-872: Removed `_handle_cache_icon_clicked()` and `_cache_icon_async()` methods.
  - Line 1457-1459: Changed button enable logic from loop to single button (install_summary only).
  - Icons still auto-fetch on app selection (existing behavior at lines 1427-1433); manual button no longer needed with background fetching.

- [x] Data.6: Implement background icon fetching with batching and rate limiting — NOTE: Added automatic background icon fetching for all apps after refresh:
  - **ApplicationService** (`src/intune_manager/services/applications.py`):
    - Lines 300-373: Added `background_fetch_icons()` method with configurable batch_size (default 10) and max_concurrent (default 3).
    - Uses asyncio.Semaphore for concurrency control; 0.5s delay between fetches for rate limiting.
    - Filters apps that already have cached icons; silently logs failures (no user-facing errors for background operations).
    - Emits `icon_cached` signal for each successful fetch to update UI incrementally.
  - **ApplicationController** (`src/intune_manager/ui/applications/controller.py`):
    - Lines 135-147: Added `background_fetch_icons()` method to expose service functionality to UI layer.
  - **ApplicationsWidget** (`src/intune_manager/ui/applications/widgets.py`):
    - Line 664: Added call to `_background_fetch_icons_async()` in `_handle_apps_refreshed()` after app list loads.
    - Lines 844-853: Added `_background_fetch_icons_async()` method to trigger background fetching via controller.
  - Icons now automatically fetch in background after app list refresh; existing 7-day TTL handles cleanup of orphaned icons for deleted apps.

### Session 2025-11-02 (continued)
- [x] Data.7: Expand MobileApp model with 35+ Graph API fields — NOTE: Added comprehensive field coverage for all app types:
  - **MobileApp Model** (`src/intune_manager/data/models/application.py`):
    - Lines 73-80: Added Priority 1 base fields (all apps): `large_icon`, `is_assigned`, `role_scope_tag_ids`, `superseding_app_count`.
    - Lines 82-102: Added Priority 2 iOS VPP fields (12 fields): `bundle_id`, `used_license_count`, `total_license_count`, `release_date_time`, `app_store_url`, `licensing_type`, `applicable_device_type`, VPP token metadata (organization_name, account_type, apple_id, display_name, id).
    - Lines 104-111: Added Priority 3 LOB app fields: `committed_content_version`, `file_name`, `size` (bytes, read-only from Graph).
    - Lines 113-127: Added Priority 4 Windows fields: `applicable_architectures`, `identity_name`, `identity_publisher_hash`, `identity_resource_identifier`, `is_bundle`, `minimum_supported_operating_system`.
    - Lines 129-134: Added Priority 5 Win32 LOB fields: `setup_file_path`, `minimum_supported_windows_release`, `display_version`.
    - Lines 136-144: Added Priority 6 Android fields: `package_id`, `version_name`, `version_code`, `minimum_supported_android_operating_system`, `app_availability`, `version`.
  - All new fields are optional (`| None`) for backward compatibility; no database migration needed (stored in existing JSON payload column).
  - Graph API field aliases configured for automatic mapping (e.g., `bundleId`, `usedLicenseCount`, `applicableArchitectures`).

- [x] UI.10: Create formatting utilities for human-readable app metadata — NOTE: Created new formatter module:
  - **Formatters Module** (`src/intune_manager/utils/formatters.py`): New file with 4 formatting functions:
    - `format_file_size(bytes_value)`: Converts bytes to KB/MB/GB/TB with 1 decimal place; returns "—" for None/0.
    - `format_license_count(used, total)`: Formats as "45 / 100 (45%)" with automatic percentage calculation.
    - `format_architecture(arch_value)`: Converts comma-separated architecture strings to display format ("x86, x64, ARM"); handles "neutral" → "Any".
    - `format_min_os(os_dict)`: Extracts minimum OS version from Graph API complex object (e.g., `{"v10_0": True, "v10_1903": True}` → "Windows 10 v1903").
  - **Utils Init** (`src/intune_manager/utils/__init__.py`):
    - Lines 36-41: Added formatter imports.
    - Lines 78-81: Exported formatter functions in `__all__`.

- [x] UI.11: Implement dynamic platform-aware field display in detail view — NOTE: Refactored ApplicationDetailPane for conditional field rendering:
  - **ApplicationDetailPane** (`src/intune_manager/ui/applications/widgets.py`):
    - Lines 48-53: Added formatter imports.
    - Lines 161-165: Changed from static field dictionary to dynamic `_metadata_form_layout` that rebuilds on each app display.
    - Lines 213-221: Added `_clear_metadata_fields()` to remove all form rows; `_add_metadata_field()` to add single field with value.
    - Lines 223-267: Added `_populate_metadata_fields()` main coordinator that shows base fields (platform, publisher, owner, dates) then conditionally adds platform/type-specific fields.
    - Lines 269-290: Added `_add_ios_vpp_fields()` for iOS VPP apps (bundle ID, license usage, VPP token, App Store URL, release date).
    - Lines 292-296: Added `_add_lob_fields()` for LOB apps (file name, file size using `format_file_size()`).
    - Lines 298-304: Added `_add_windows_lob_fields()` for Windows LOB (committed version, setup file path).
    - Lines 306-320: Added `_add_windows_fields()` for Windows apps (architecture using `format_architecture()`, identity fields, min OS using `format_min_os()`, bundle status).
    - Lines 322-331: Added `_add_win32_fields()` for Win32 apps (display version, min Windows release).
    - Lines 333-346: Added `_add_android_lob_fields()` for Android LOB (package ID, version name/code).
    - Lines 268: Updated `display_app()` to call `_populate_metadata_fields()` instead of manual field setting.
    - Removed obsolete `_set_field()` method and `_format_value()` function.
  - Metadata section now shows 8-20 fields depending on app type/platform; only populated fields are displayed (no empty rows).

- [x] Bug.5: Fix icon fetch AttributeError crash — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/ui/applications/widgets.py:1511-1516` removed auto-fetch-on-selection code that called deleted `_cache_icon_async()` method; this method was removed in previous session when manual "Fetch icon" button was deleted, but the auto-fetch call was missed. Icons are now exclusively fetched via background batch process implemented in Data.6; eliminates "AttributeError: 'ApplicationsWidget' object has no attribute '_cache_icon_async'" crash that caused background fetch failures and greyed-out action buttons.

- [x] UI.12: Enable inline filter/mode editing in assignment editor — NOTE: Implemented full inline editing for assignment filters:
  - **Assignment Editor** (`src/intune_manager/ui/assignments/assignment_editor.py`):
    - Lines 323-392: Refactored `_rebuild_table()` to replace read-only filter/filter_mode QTableWidgetItems with editable QComboBox widgets (mirroring existing intent combo pattern).
    - Lines 344-367: Filter combo populated with "No filter" + all available filters from `self._filters`; current filter selected; disabled for non-group targets; connected to `_update_filter()` handler.
    - Lines 369-387: Filter mode combo with three options ("—", "Include", "Exclude"); current mode selected; disabled for non-group targets or when no filter selected; connected to `_update_filter_mode()` handler.
    - Lines 414-449: Added `_update_filter()` method to update GroupAssignmentTarget with new filter ID; automatically clears filter mode to NONE when filter removed; dynamically enables/disables filter mode combo based on filter selection.
    - Lines 451-483: Added `_update_filter_mode()` method to update GroupAssignmentTarget with new filter mode; includes validation to prevent setting mode to NONE when filter is selected (shows warning dialog and reverts combo).
  - Changes propagate to `self._assignments` list via `model_copy()` and are automatically included when `desired_assignments()` is called on dialog accept.
  - Users can now edit filters and filter modes directly in the table without removing and re-adding assignment targets.

- [x] Bug.6: Fix bulk assignment silent failure — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/ui/applications/bulk_assignment.py` added missing `settings: AssignmentSettings | None = None` field to `BulkAssignmentPlan` dataclass (line 39) and added `AssignmentSettings` import (line 25); the apply logic in `widgets.py:1221` tried to access `plan.settings` which didn't exist on the dataclass, causing an `AttributeError` that was silently caught by the broad exception handler; users would click "Apply" in bulk assignment wizard and nothing would happen (no assignments created, no error shown); bulk assignment now works properly.

### Session 2025-11-23
- [x] UX.16: De-noise auth failures and make toasts expire — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/ui/components/notifications.py` now deduplicates identical toasts within 4s, defaults warnings/errors to auto-dismiss after 7s, and no longer makes errors sticky by default. Applications/Devices widgets (`src/intune_manager/ui/applications/widgets.py:811-824`, `src/intune_manager/ui/devices/widgets.py:834-846`) collapse repeated AuthenticationError events into a single warning with guidance to re-auth in Settings.
- [x] UI.13: Restore cached app icons in UI — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/services/applications.py:246-249` emits `icon_cached` when icons are already cached; Applications page (`src/intune_manager/ui/applications/widgets.py:672-675,826-828`) now triggers background icon load even for cached app lists so icons show immediately after startup.
- [x] UI.14: Unblock Applications refresh overlay — NOTE: Applications refresh now uses non-blocking busy overlay (`src/intune_manager/ui/applications/widgets.py:853-856`) and BusyOverlay container width was widened to avoid cropped text (`src/intune_manager/ui/components/overlays.py:37-40`).
- [x] Bug.7: Fix assignment editor exec crash and target reset — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/ui/applications/widgets.py:1015` compares dialog result against `QDialog.DialogCode.Accepted` to avoid `AttributeError`; `src/intune_manager/ui/assignments/assignment_editor.py:85-90` clears group/filter selections when switching target type back to "All devices".
- [x] Data.8: Reduce stale device warnings — NOTE: Device cache TTL increased to 45 minutes (`src/intune_manager/services/devices.py:20-26`), and Devices page auto-triggers a refresh when cache is stale on load (`src/intune_manager/ui/devices/widgets.py:808-821`).
- [x] Bug.8: Prevent concurrent device refresh during global sync — NOTE: Added `SyncService.is_refreshing` guard (`src/intune_manager/services/sync.py:31-46,63-67,87-103`) and Devices auto-refresh now skips when a tenant sync is already running (`src/intune_manager/ui/devices/widgets.py:813-819`); avoids SQLite "database is locked" errors from overlapping writes.
- [x] Bug.9: Fix assignment apply JSON decode on 204 responses — NOTE: Graph assign action returns 204 No Content; `src/intune_manager/graph/client.py:510-523` now treats empty/204 responses as `{}` to prevent JSONDecodeError during assignment apply.
- [x] Assign.1: Use Graph batch for assignment apply with retries — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/services/assignments.py` now sends upserts + deletes via `/batch` (beta), with 429/503 retry/backoff and consistent 204 handling; removes split code path between assign action and delete calls.
- [x] UI.15: Bulk assignment supports All devices/All users — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/ui/applications/bulk_assignment.py` adds sentinel entries for All devices/All users; `src/intune_manager/ui/applications/widgets.py` maps them to `AllDevicesAssignmentTarget`/`AllLicensedUsersAssignmentTarget` with filter modes preserved; assignment target models now include filter fields for these targets (`src/intune_manager/data/models/assignment.py`).
- [x] Assign.2: Batch multiple apps per call and fix Content-Type in batch bodies — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/services/assignments.py` adds `apply_diffs()` to batch many app assignment changes into chunks of 20 `/batch` requests with 429/503 retry; bulk wizard now uses it instead of per-app calls (`src/intune_manager/ui/applications/widgets.py`, controller); batch entries now force `Content-Type: application/json` for writes (`src/intune_manager/graph/requests.py`).

**Start at the top and work your way down**

- [x] Assign.3: Fix Graph batch assign URL versioning + return paths — NOTE: `_normalise_batch_url` now strips embedded /beta when calling `/beta/$batch` to avoid “Resource not found for the segment 'beta'” errors, and `_execute_batch_with_retry` returns collected responses instead of `None` (`src/intune_manager/graph/requests.py`, `src/intune_manager/services/assignments.py`).
- [x] UI.17: Re-enable Applications toolbar after refresh completes — NOTE: `_refresh_async` now always clears busy state and re-enables Refresh/Force Refresh buttons so the Applications page no longer gets stuck after navigation (`src/intune_manager/ui/applications/widgets.py`).
- [x] Data.9: Reduce SQLite lock failures — NOTE: SQLite connection timeout increased to 30s to give long-running deletes time to complete during tenant sync (`src/intune_manager/data/sql/engine.py`).
- [x] UI.18: Show cached app icons and avoid unnecessary refetch — NOTE: Background icon fetch now emits cached icons immediately and only downloads missing ones; UI passes active tenant ID to icon fetch to avoid re-fetching per launch (`src/intune_manager/services/applications.py`, `src/intune_manager/ui/applications/widgets.py`). Added Application Type column to the applications table using the derived `app_type` (`src/intune_manager/ui/applications/models.py`).
- [x] UI.19: Fix application type display error — NOTE: Application table now calls `get_display_name` with both platform and type to avoid TypeError and to show correct “Type” values (`src/intune_manager/ui/applications/models.py`).
- [x] Data.10: Prevent SQLite lock during device refresh — NOTE: SQLite engine now forces WAL mode + synchronous=NORMAL + busy_timeout via connect pragmas; DeviceRepository refresh loads records before a short transaction and retries locked writes with backoff (`src/intune_manager/data/sql/engine.py`, `src/intune_manager/data/repositories/devices.py`). Tests: `uv run pytest tests/data/test_device_repository.py`.
- [x] Utils.5: Expand Graph app type coverage for macOS + other platforms — NOTE: `src/intune_manager/utils/app_types.py` now maps `macOsVppApp`, Managed Store aliases, Windows AppX/phone variants, and treats type lookups case-insensitively; platform compatibility updated so VPP includes macOS, Web is cross-platform, and Edge/AppX reflect Windows support. Fixes missing macOS VPP/PKG/LOB types in the Applications picker/filter.
- [x] UI.20: Show cached apps while refresh runs — NOTE: Applications widget now reads cache and triggers refresh using the active tenant ID so the grid stays populated during startup/sync instead of emptying until a refresh completes (`src/intune_manager/ui/applications/widgets.py`).
- [x] UI.21: Seed type picker with all supported combos per platform — NOTE: Type dropdown now pre-populates combinations for platforms present in the cache using `PLATFORM_TYPE_COMPATIBILITY`, so macOS LOB/PKG/VPP and other known types show up even when no current app instance exists (`src/intune_manager/ui/applications/widgets.py`). Also rehydrates app_type/platformType when reading cached app records (`src/intune_manager/data/sql/mapper.py`) to preserve filters across restarts.
- [x] Graph.4: Request full metadata for app type detection — NOTE: Graph client now sends `Accept: application/json;odata.metadata=full` so `@odata.type` is returned for derived app resources (macOS PKG/LOB/VPP, etc.), allowing accurate platform/type inference (`src/intune_manager/graph/client.py`). Refresh applications once to repopulate cache with correct types.
- [x] Bug.10: Infer app platform/type from installer filenames when @odata.type is missing — NOTE: `MobileApp` model now derives platform/type from common file extensions (e.g., `.pkg` → macOS PKG, `.msi` → Windows MSI) so legacy cached apps without `@odata.type` no longer show as Unknown; tests added in `tests/data/test_domain_models.py`.
- [x] Bug.11: Recover app icons when `/largeIcon/$value` fails — NOTE: `ApplicationService.cache_icon()` now fetches the inline `largeIcon` payload (base64) and stores it before falling back to the media endpoint; fixes consistent 400s and empty icons. Added regression test `tests/services/test_application_icons.py` using metadata fallback.
- [x] Bug.12: Force refresh when cached apps miss platform/type metadata — NOTE: `ApplicationService.refresh()` now triggers a fetch if any cached app has an unknown platform or missing app_type (common for macOS VPP apps created with legacy minimal payloads), ensuring the grid shows correct platform/type. Added `tests/services/test_application_refresh_metadata.py`.
- [x] Bug.13: Infer platform/type from App Store/Store URLs when @odata.type is missing — NOTE: `ApplicationService` now hydrates missing platform/app_type from `informationUrl`/`appStoreUrl` (e.g., macOS App Store links with `mt=12` → macOS Store), preventing “Unknown” rows for macOS VPP/App Store items. Counts after force refresh: ios VPP 252, macOS DMG 22, macOS PKG 18, macOS Store 7, Office Suite 1, Defender 1.
- [x] Graph.5: Fetch mobileApps via Graph beta to include Windows/Android/WinGet types — NOTE: Added `/deviceAppManagement/mobileApps` API version override to beta so non-Apple apps return in the catalog (`src/intune_manager/graph/client.py`); regression test `tests/graph/test_client_version_overrides.py`. Force-refresh applications to repopulate cache with Windows/Android entries.
- [x] Bug.14: Infer Windows platform for WinGet/OfficeSuite apps — NOTE: `MobileApp` now maps `#microsoft.graph.winGetApp`/OfficeSuite types to Windows and uses app_type compatibility for platform when unambiguous; `ApplicationService` also fills missing platform from app_type. Regression test `tests/data/test_domain_models.py::test_mobile_app_infers_platform_for_winget_app`.

### Session 2025-11-23 (API beta review)
- [x] Graph.6: Fix install summary by using reports action (beta) — NOTE: `installSummary` nav was removed from `deviceAppManagement/mobileApps` in both beta/v1 metadata (causing 400 “segment 'installSummary'” errors). `ApplicationService.fetch_install_summary()` now calls `deviceManagement/reports/getAppsInstallSummaryReport` (beta) via `mobile_app_install_summary_report_request`, decodes the base64 CSV, and maps counts (installed/failed/pending/not installed/not applicable for devices/users) with source metadata. Raw row returned in errors for debugging; invalid/missing payload raises `GraphAPIError` instead of surfacing Graph 400s to users. Files: `src/intune_manager/services/applications.py`, `src/intune_manager/graph/requests.py`.
- [x] Graph.7: Default Graph client to beta — NOTE: `GraphClientConfig.api_version` now defaults to beta to surface newer Intune features without per-endpoint overrides (`src/intune_manager/graph/client.py`). Existing overrides remain (mobileApps, managedDevices, assignmentFilters, auditEvents, configurationPolicies). Monitor for any endpoints that require pinning back to v1.
- [x] Auth.4: Add group delete scope + auto-merge defaults — NOTE: Added `Group.ReadWrite.All` to default scopes and `Settings.configured_scopes()` now unions saved scopes with updated defaults so new permissions are requested and surfaced in missing-scope warnings (`src/intune_manager/config/settings.py`). Required for deleting groups (avoid “Insufficient privileges” 403). Re-auth to consent.
- [x] Groups.5: Delete multiple groups in one action — NOTE: Groups UI now respects multi-selection for delete, confirms count/preview, and deletes all selected groups with aggregated error reporting (`src/intune_manager/ui/groups/widgets.py`). Delete button enabled for multi-select, not just single selection.
