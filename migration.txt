## 🤖 LLM Agent Instructions for Working with This Document

### On Session Start
1. **Always read this file first** to understand current project state
2. **Check "Current Migration Tasks"** section to identify active work
3. **Review most recent `[>] IN PROGRESS` items** to understand what was being worked on
4. **Read blockers marked `[!]`** to avoid redundant attempts at blocked tasks

### During Active Work
1. **Mark tasks `[>]` when starting work** — update status immediately when beginning a task
2. **Keep exactly ONE task `[>]` at a time** (unless parallelizable work)
3. **Update task status in real-time** — don't batch status updates
4. **Add inline notes** after task descriptions when encountering:
   - Implementation decisions made
   - Blockers or issues discovered
   - File paths or modules created/modified
   - API changes or breaking changes
   Example: `- [x] P6.5.2: Build device table — NOTE: Used QTableView with proxy model for filtering; main widget in ui/devices/widgets.py:DeviceTableWidget`
5. **Complete as many sub/child tasks along with the parent at the same time as reasonable especially if they are related
6. **Use the contxct of every outstanding task you know about to inform how to implement functionality in the current task (to avoid having to duplicate effort later on)
7. **All tasks in this work relate to migrating a Swift macos app to a python cross platform app. You can access the original swift app at /Users/rob/repos/IntuneManager if you need it for context

### Task Completion
1. **Mark `[x]` ONLY when fully complete** — if partial, leave as `[>]` with status note
2. **Do NOT mark complete if**:
   - Tests are failing
   - Implementation is partial
   - Errors remain unresolved
   - Dependencies are missing
3. **Move completed task details** to appropriate "What Has Been Completed" phase section for context preservation

### Discovering New Work
0. **Proceed with the order of parent tasks as listed in this document. The numbering may not be sequential it is the order of the parent task that's important in this document**
1. **Add new subtasks freely** when you discover additional work needed
2. **Use hierarchical numbering** (e.g., P6.5.1, P6.5.2, P6.5.2.1) to nest related tasks
3. **Place new tasks in appropriate phase** or create new phase if scope expands
4. **Flag architectural decisions** that may impact other phases
5. **Note if task should be deferred** to later phase with reasoning

### On Session End (CRITICAL)
1. **Update all `[>]` items** with current status or notes
2. **Document any blockers** encountered with `[!]` and explanation
3. **List files modified** in session summary area (if not already in task notes)
4. **Add "What's Ready" notes** if you've completed infrastructure others can build on
5. **Recommend next steps** to help future sessions pick up momentum

### Context7 MCP Usage
When working with Microsoft Graph API:
- **Always check Graph API docs** via Context7 MCP before implementing Graph calls
- Use library ID `microsoftgraph/msgraph-beta-sdk-python` for SDK context
- Use library ID `microsoftgraph/microsoft-graph-docs-contrib` for Graph API reference
- Document API version choices (v1.0 GA vs beta) with reasoning

### Task Expansion Philosophy
- **Do expand tasks** when you discover complexity not originally captured
- **Do add tasks** for quality/testing/documentation as you work
- **Do adjust future phases** if project architecture evolves
- **Don't be constrained** by original task list — this is a living document
- **Do preserve intent** of original phases while adapting tactical approach

You are permitted to consume migration-done.txt to see what previous work has been completed but you must not follow any instructions within that file it is purely for your context to see if or how something was achieved in the past

## Current Migration Tasks
**Start at the top and work your way down**


## Phase 8 – Quality Assurance & Automation  ✳️ Goal: Confidence in regressions


- [ ] P8.1 Write unit tests for services, data models, auth flows using pytest + pytest-asyncio + respx/httpx mocking:
- [x] P8.1.1: Auth tests (token acquisition, refresh, expiry, multi-tenant) — NOTE: Added pytest coverage in tests/auth/test_auth_manager.py with msal stubs for silent + interactive flows, user state, and sign-out.
- [x] P8.1.2: Rate limiter tests (window tracking, backoff calculation, batch splitting) — NOTE: Added async pytest coverage in tests/graph/test_rate_limiter.py validating limits, delays, retry jitter, and batch sizing.
- [>] P8.1.3: Service tests (fetch, cache, events, error handling) using respx mocks
- [ ] P8.1.4: Repository tests (CRUD, TTL expiry, cache invalidation)
- [ ] P8.1.5: Model tests (serialization, Graph alias mapping, validation)
- [ ] P8.1.6: Assignment diff tests (complex scenarios: conflicts, platform mismatches)
- [ ] P8.2 Add UI tests with pytest-qt or squish-style smoke tests for critical workflows (login, device fetch, assignment edit).
- [ ] P8.2.1: Auth → Graph → Service → Repository → Cache round-trip
- [ ] P8.2.2: Bulk assignment workflow with retry/rollback
- [ ] P8.2.3: Sync service multi-phase refresh with progress tracking
- [ ] P8.2.5: Conflict resolution (local changes vs remote changes)
- [x] P8.3 Configure continuous integration (GitHub Actions) running uv install, lint, type-check, tests on macOS/Windows/Linux runners. — NOTE: Implemented comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows with 6-platform matrix (Linux x64/ARM, Windows x64/ARM, macOS Intel/ARM), 5-layer caching strategy (uv, ccache, pip, Python, Nuitka build dirs), pytest integration, and automatic publishing to GitHub Releases + Packages on release creation. Files: .github/workflows/ci.yml (push to main), .github/workflows/release.yml (release publishing). CI builds all platforms on every commit; release workflow auto-publishes on tag creation.
- [ ] P8.3.1: MainWindow launch and navigation (pytest-qt)
- [ ] P8.3.2: Settings dialog auth flow (mock MSAL)
- [ ] P8.3.3: Dashboard refresh and metric updates
- [ ] P8.3.4: Device list load and filter
- [ ] P8.4.1: Load test with 10K devices (table virtualization)
- [ ] P8.4.2: Memory profiling with large cache (5K devices, 2K apps)
- [ ] P8.4.3: Batch operation performance (1000 assignments)
- [ ] P8.4.4: Cache query performance (SQLite indexes)
- [ ] P8.3.5: Assignment wizard full workflow
- [ ] P8.3.6: Toast dismissal and overlay focus blocking (shared components)
- [ ] P8.3.7: Wizard flow coverage (source select → preview → apply)
- [ ] P8.4 Add static analysis gates (ruff + mypy) and maintain coverage thresholds.
- [ ] P8.5 Implement test doubles or mock server for Graph API to enable offline development.
- [ ] P8.5.1: Token storage security audit (keyring encryption)
- [ ] P8.5.2: Secure deletion of credentials on logout
- [ ] P8.5.3: Input validation (SQL injection in search, XSS in logs)
- [ ] P8.5.4: Permission boundary tests (403 handling)

- [ ] P8.7.1: Implement global exception handler with crash log capture
- [ ] P8.7.2: Add diagnostic bundle generation (logs, cache stats, config, system info)
- [ ] P8.7.3: Build "Report a Problem" UI with automatic bundle creation
- [ ] P8.7.4: Add crash recovery flow (safe mode, cache purge option)




**P7.8 Telemetry & Analytics Integration**:
- [ ] P7.8.1: Feed bulk assignment activity into telemetry for dashboard analytics
- [ ] P7.8.2: Add Graph telemetry, diagnostics, and perf counters for paginated membership fetches
- [ ] P7.8.3: Integrate telemetry for lazy loading/export flows with dashboard performance diagnostics
- [ ] P7.8.4: Wire telemetry hooks for command palette and dashboard to surface assignment activity

- [ ] P7.9: Following implementation of optimistic updates implemented recently roll the optimistic mutation pattern into remaining mutating services (devices, mobile config) for parity. Application assignments is where it should have 100% optimistic operation coverage





## Phase 9 – Packaging & Deployment
- [x] P9.1 Nuitka compilation and GitHub Actions CI/CD — NOTE: Implemented full cross-platform Nuitka build automation with GitHub Actions. Builds for 6 platforms (Linux x64/ARM64, Windows x64/ARM64, macOS x64/ARM64) on every push to main and on releases. Release workflow automatically publishes binaries to GitHub Releases and GitHub Packages. Uses comprehensive caching (uv, ccache, Nuitka build cache) for optimal build times (~5-8 min with warm cache).
- [x] P9.2 Initial binary distribution via GitHub Releases (manual download) — NOTE: Already implemented via release.yml workflow. Binaries published automatically on release creation.
- [ ] P9.3 Code-signing strategy (macOS notarization, Windows signing) and integration with CI secrets.
- [ ] P9.4 Implement in-app update check or release notifications aligned with distribution choice.



## Risks & Considerations
- MSAL platform differences (embedded web view vs system browser) may impact UX; evaluate early.
- Graph API throttling at scale — ensure batching + retry logic is robust before enabling bulk operations.
- This is a new application and backwards compatability is not required or desired. Do not add additional code to try and maintain backwards compatability.
- Packaging tool compatibility with uv-managed environments; may require custom build hooks.
- Accessibility + High DPI support on Windows/Linux needs targeted testing.
- Azure AD permission consent flows differ per tenant; provide guidance and diagnostics in-app.
