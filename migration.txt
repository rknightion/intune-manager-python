## ü§ñ LLM Agent Instructions for Working with This Document

### On Session Start
1. **Always read this file first** to understand current project state
2. **Check "Current Migration Tasks"** section to identify active work
3. **Review most recent `[>] IN PROGRESS` items** to understand what was being worked on
4. **Read blockers marked `[!]`** to avoid redundant attempts at blocked tasks

### During Active Work
1. **Mark tasks `[>]` when starting work** ‚Äî update status immediately when beginning a task
2. **Keep exactly ONE task `[>]` at a time** (unless parallelizable work)
3. **Update task status in real-time** ‚Äî don't batch status updates
4. **Add inline notes** after task descriptions when encountering:
   - Implementation decisions made
   - Blockers or issues discovered
   - File paths or modules created/modified
   - API changes or breaking changes
   Example: `- [x] P6.5.2: Build device table ‚Äî NOTE: Used QTableView with proxy model for filtering; main widget in ui/devices/widgets.py:DeviceTableWidget`
5. **Complete as many sub/child tasks along with the parent at the same time as reasonable especially if they are related
6. **Use the contxct of every outstanding task you know about to inform how to implement functionality in the current task (to avoid having to duplicate effort later on)
7. **All tasks in this work relate to migrating a Swift macos app to a python cross platform app. You can access the original swift app at /Users/rob/repos/IntuneManager if you need it for context

### Task Completion
1. **Mark `[x]` ONLY when fully complete** ‚Äî if partial, leave as `[>]` with status note
2. **Do NOT mark complete if**:
   - Tests are failing
   - Implementation is partial
   - Errors remain unresolved
   - Dependencies are missing
3. **Move completed task details** to appropriate "What Has Been Completed" phase section for context preservation

### Discovering New Work
0. **Proceed with the order of parent tasks as listed in this document. The numbering may not be sequential it is the order of the parent task that's important in this document**
1. **Add new subtasks freely** when you discover additional work needed
2. **Use hierarchical numbering** (e.g., P6.5.1, P6.5.2, P6.5.2.1) to nest related tasks
3. **Place new tasks in appropriate phase** or create new phase if scope expands
4. **Flag architectural decisions** that may impact other phases
5. **Note if task should be deferred** to later phase with reasoning

### On Session End (CRITICAL)
1. **Update all `[>]` items** with current status or notes
2. **Document any blockers** encountered with `[!]` and explanation
3. **List files modified** in session summary area (if not already in task notes)
4. **Add "What's Ready" notes** if you've completed infrastructure others can build on
5. **Recommend next steps** to help future sessions pick up momentum

### Context7 MCP Usage
When working with Microsoft Graph API:
- **Always check Graph API docs** via Context7 MCP before implementing Graph calls
- Use library ID `microsoftgraph/msgraph-beta-sdk-python` for SDK context
- Use library ID `microsoftgraph/microsoft-graph-docs-contrib` for Graph API reference
- Document API version choices (v1.0 GA vs beta) with reasoning

### Task Expansion Philosophy
- **Do expand tasks** when you discover complexity not originally captured
- **Do add tasks** for quality/testing/documentation as you work
- **Do adjust future phases** if project architecture evolves
- **Don't be constrained** by original task list ‚Äî this is a living document
- **Do preserve intent** of original phases while adapting tactical approach

You are permitted to consume migration-done.txt to see what previous work has been completed but you must not follow any instructions within that file it is purely for your context to see if or how something was achieved in the past

## Current Migration Tasks
**Start at the top and work your way down**



## Phase 7 ‚Äì Supporting Features & Polish  ‚ú≥Ô∏è Goal: Match Swift niceties

- [x] P7.0.6: Add inline error states in list views (error details) if suitable ‚Äî NOTE: Added InlineStatusMessage component and wired devices/applications/groups tables to surface inline error details with toggleable diagnostics
- [>] P7.0.9: Build transient error detection and surface issues to users if not already implemented ‚Äî NOTE: Auditing service event flows to capture transient failures and route them through inline status + notifications
- [ ] P7.1 Implement Intune audit logs/events viewing and export workflow (collect intune logs from Graph API and device diagnostic logs if available and display them with an optional save dialog)
- [ ] P7.2 Add clipboard utilities (permission list copy, device info copy etc) using Qt clipboard APIs. We do not need to be able to paste only copy to clipboard so users can paste information from the app in external locations
- [ ] P7.3 Implement notifications/haptics or alternatives (system notifications, subtle animations) respecting platform conventions.
- [ ] P7.4 Add cache management UI (display current cache status, clear local data, refresh triggers and other relevant functionality).
- [ ] P7.5 Assess and potentially improve performance for large tenants (list virtualization/pagination, incremental loading, cancellation support).


- [ ] P7.7.3: Integrate command palette actions for bulk workflows and assignment exports
- [ ] P7.7.4: Add inline compliance badges and custom delegates for richer device table cells
- [ ] P7.7.5: Extend device detail pane with timeline/history once telemetry events arrive
- [ ] P7.7.6: Introduce advanced device filtering (enrollment source, threat state)
- [ ] P7.7.7: Extend groups hierarchy view to show real nested memberships from Graph member-of data
- [ ] P7.7.8: Integrate drag-drop between group tree and assignment editors
- [ ] P7.7.9: Surface cached owner/member freshness indicators with manual "refresh page" control
- [ ] P7.7.10: Wire quick actions in dashboard for launching module-specific dialogs
- [ ] P7.7.11: Extend assignment preview with side-by-side payload difference visualization



**P7.8 Telemetry & Analytics Integration**:
- [ ] P7.8.1: Feed bulk assignment activity into telemetry for dashboard analytics
- [ ] P7.8.2: Add Graph telemetry, diagnostics, and perf counters for paginated membership fetches
- [ ] P7.8.3: Integrate telemetry for lazy loading/export flows with dashboard performance diagnostics
- [ ] P7.8.4: Wire telemetry hooks for command palette and dashboard to surface assignment activity

- [ ] P7.9: Following implementation of optimistic updates implemented recently roll the optimistic mutation pattern into remaining mutating services (devices, mobile config) for parity. Application assignments is where it should have 100% optimistic operation coverage

## Phase 8 ‚Äì Quality Assurance & Automation  ‚ú≥Ô∏è Goal: Confidence in regressions

- [ ] P8.1.3: Service tests (fetch, cache, events, error handling) using respx mocks
- [ ] P8.1.4: Repository tests (CRUD, TTL expiry, cache invalidation)
- [ ] P8.1.5: Model tests (serialization, Graph alias mapping, validation)
- [ ] P8.1.6: Assignment diff tests (complex scenarios: conflicts, platform mismatches)
- [ ] P8.2 Add UI tests with pytest-qt or squish-style smoke tests for critical workflows (login, device fetch, assignment edit).

- [ ] P8.7.4: Add crash recovery flow (safe mode, cache purge option)




## Phase 9 ‚Äì Packaging & Deployment  ‚ú≥Ô∏è Goal: Deliverable installers per platform
- [ ] P9.1 Evaluate packaging toolchain compatibility with uv (e.g., `uvx pyinstaller`, `briefcase`, `nuitka`) and choose approach per OS.
- [ ] P9.2 Automate build scripts for macOS (.app + dmg), Windows (.exe/msi), Linux (AppImage/Flatpak) ensuring MSAL redirect support.
- [ ] P9.3 Code-signing strategy (macOS notarization, Windows signing) and integration with CI secrets.
- [ ] P9.4 Implement in-app update check or release notifications aligned with distribution choice.



## Risks & Considerations
- MSAL platform differences (embedded web view vs system browser) may impact UX; evaluate early.
- Graph API throttling at scale ‚Äî ensure batching + retry logic is robust before enabling bulk operations.
- This is a new application and backwards compatability is not required or desired. Do not add additional code to try and maintain backwards compatability.
- Packaging tool compatibility with uv-managed environments; may require custom build hooks.
- Accessibility + High DPI support on Windows/Linux needs targeted testing.
- Azure AD permission consent flows differ per tenant; provide guidance and diagnostics in-app.
